# ShopMate, a product display and shopping cart UI made easy!

A simple UI that displays products but also offers shopping cart functionality. Styling is handled by TailwindCSS, while functionality is implemented with React. Product database simulation is done utilizing JSON Server. React's Context API is used to implement state sharing within the App's contained components. Products added to cart persist between sessions throught the usage of localStorage.

Made with:

- React and its Context API for state sharing
- TailwindCSS
- JSON Server
- localStorage for state persistence
